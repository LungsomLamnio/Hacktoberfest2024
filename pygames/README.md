# Pygames Directory

Welcome to the Pygames directory! This repository is dedicated to showcasing and building games developed in Python using the Pygame library. Contributors are welcome to submit their games by following the installation, contribution, and folder structure guidelines detailed below.

## How to Install Pygame

To install Pygame, use the following command:

`pip install pygame`
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can verify the installation of Pygame by running a simple script:

`import pygame`
`print(pygame.ver)`
If Pygame is installed correctly, it will display the version number.

## How to Contribute New Games

We encourage the community to contribute their Pygame projects. Follow the steps below to contribute your game:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Folder:** In your forked repository, create a folder inside /pygames named after your game (e.g., /space_invaders).
3. **Add Your Files:**
   Place your main Python script as main.py.
   If your game includes assets (images, sounds, etc.), organize them inside an /assets folder within your game directory.
4. **Write a Game README:** Add a README.md file inside your game's folder. This file should include:
   Game Description: Overview of your game and gameplay mechanics.
   Installation Instructions: Steps to install necessary dependencies (e.g., pip install pygame).
   Controls: Describe the controls for playing the game.
   Screenshots: If possible, add gameplay screenshots and link them inside the README.md file.
5. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once you're ready, submit a pull request to merge your game into the main repository.

## Folder Structure Guidelines for Submitting Games

When submitting a game, please follow this folder structure for consistency:

/pygames
├── /game_name # Folder for each game project
│ ├── main.py # Main file to run the game
│ ├── /assets # (Optional) Images, sounds, and other assets
│ ├── README.md # Game-specific documentation
├── README.md # General documentation (this file)
Example Structure
For example, if you're contributing a game called "Space Invaders":

bash
Copy code
/pygames
├── /space_invaders
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── /assets
│ ├── README.md
General Contribution Rules
Use of Pygame: Ensure that your game is developed using the Pygame library.
Code Quality: Write clean and modular code. Comment where necessary for clarity.
Testing: Thoroughly test your game to ensure it runs without errors.
Naming: Use meaningful names for files and assets to maintain organization.
Dependencies: If your game has external dependencies, include a requirements.txt file with the required packages.
